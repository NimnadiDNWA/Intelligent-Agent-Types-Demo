# Intelligent-Agent-Types-Demo
A demonstration of various intelligent agent types, implemented in Python, showcasing how different agents make decisions in different environments. Includes Simple Reflex, Model-Based, Goal-Based, Utility-Based, and Learning agents.


## Agent Types

1. **Simple Reflex Agents**:
   - React based on current perception.
   - Example: A basic thermostat that turns on/off the heating based on temperature.

2. **Model-Based Reflex Agents**:
   - Maintain an internal state to keep track of the environment's past states.
   - Example: A Roomba vacuum cleaner that remembers the rooms it has cleaned.

3. **Goal-Based Agents**:
   - Make decisions based on goals they aim to achieve.
   - Example: A GPS navigation system planning a route to a destination.

4. **Utility-Based Agents**:
   - Evaluate the utility of actions and make decisions to maximize their "happiness."
   - Example: A smart thermostat that balances comfort and energy cost.

5. **Learning Agents**:
   - Learn from experience and adapt over time.
   - Example: A recommendation system that improves over time based on user preferences.

## Features

- **Agent Simulation**: Interactive visualizations to simulate different agents in environments.
- **Performance Comparison**: Comparison of agents' performance, response time, and success rate.
- **Interactive Decision Making**: Allows users to see how different agents make decisions in various scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
    - ipywidgets (for interactive features)

You can install the required libraries using:

pip install numpy matplotlib pandas ipywidgets

Running the Code
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/NimnadiDNWA/Intelligent-Agent-Types-Demo.git
cd Intelligent-Agent-Types-Demo

Run the Python scripts in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE, etc.).

To visualize agent decisions or performance, run the provided code cells.
